# womentree Web Platform

womentree is a web platform that connects women job seekers with job providers to facilitate employment opportunities. We aim to empower unskilled women by providing them jobs like babysitting, cooking, househelp, and tailoring, which allow them to become financially independent. Our web app helps working women find reliable services for tasks like childcare, eldercare, cleaning, and laundry so that they can focus on their careers without stress. womentree brings women together to support each other's professional and personal growth.
